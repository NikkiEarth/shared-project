<h1> About Us: The Founders of Beautiful Brains </h1>

<p> Here is our get to know us page, where you can find out more about us here at beautiful brains.
    I'm Nikita a recent graduate of biomedical science and Piriye is currently a student of chemical engineering, studying at Leeds University.
    We are 22 and 20 years of age and are both learning web development, as a new skill. Using these new skills we have made this wesite to showcase
    our shared lifestyle interests and passions such as photography and baking.
    From a very young age food has been central to both our different cultures, from this came our enthusiasm for food.
    Baking is a fun activity that helps to relieve stress as well as taking photos outdoors which has also been shown to improve well being.
    As well as showcasing the beauty of nature and its surroundings.Our website is here to help share our hobbies in our lives that help promote healthy living. </p>
